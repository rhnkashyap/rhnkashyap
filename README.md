### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Rohan Kashyap. I am a Software Engineer at Tech Mahindra Ltd. in India. I've previously worked on Java Web technologies and Spring Boot. Switched to MEAN stack development to create things differently. Fell in love with Node when I created my first API with it. Decided to carry on with it, which brings us to today.

A Gamer and an Otaku!! I can help you compile a list of PC parts for your next Big rig.  

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing applications using MEAN stack.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React to add MERN in my arsenal of abilities.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything matching my current expertise OR something new and head scratching enough.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help to dive deep in MEAN where the sunlight never reaches.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything mentioned above. I'll help you learn.
